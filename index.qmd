My name is Elizabeth (Libby) Kula. I’m a doctoral candidate in the Department of Applied Economics at the University of Minnesota. My studies were concentrated in the environmental/natural resource economics and policy fields. I am currently working on my dissertation while serving in an ABD Assistant Professor position at St. Catherine University’s Economics & Political Science Department. 

My research interests include ecosystem services, natural capital accounting, and equity. In my dissertation, I would like to leverage household survey data and geospatial environmental data to estimate the distribution of ecosystem services across space and socio-economic characteristics over time and in response to policy changes.
