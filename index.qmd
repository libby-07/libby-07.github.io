My name is Elizabeth (Libby) Kula. Iâ€™m a doctoral candidate in the Department of Applied Economics at the University of Minnesota. My studies were concentrated in the environmental/natural resource economics and policy fields. I am currently completing my dissertation while on the 2025-26 job market. I have experience and interest in both research and teaching positions. 

My research interests include ecosystem services, nature-based solutions, urban green space, and equity. In my dissertation, I leverage household survey data and geospatial environmental data to estimate the distribution of urban ecosystem services across space and socio-economic characteristics over time and in response to policy changes.
